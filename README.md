# Stremio Community Subtitles Addon

A Stremio addon that enables you to use custom subtitles on any device - something normally only possible on desktop Stremio. Simply upload your subtitle files for the video you just started watching, and they'll be instantly available across all your devices through the addon.

Every subtitle you upload helps build a community database that benefits all users. The OpenSubtitles integration allows manual selection of any available subtitles and linking them to specific video versions, ensuring perfectly synchronized subtitles for future viewers.

## üì± Usage

### Quick Start for Any Device:
1. **Start Watching** - Begin playing any movie or TV show on any device (mobile, TV, desktop)
2. **Check Homepage** - Visit the [addon homepage](https://stremio-community-subtitles.top) to see your recent viewing history
3. **Upload or Select Subtitles** - Click on the video you're watching and either:
   - Upload your own subtitle file, or
   - Browse and select from OpenSubtitles database
4. **Link to Video** - The subtitle gets linked to your specific video file
5. **Instant Access** - Return to Stremio and select the Community Subtitles available in the subtitles list
6. **Help Others** - Your contribution is now available for other users watching the same video file

## üéØ How It Works

**The Key Innovation:** Stremio's desktop app allows loading external subtitle files by drag and drop, but mobile and TV apps don't support this feature. This addon bridges that gap by letting you upload or select subtitles through the web interface and instantly access them on any device.

**Community Building:** Every subtitle uploaded or linked helps create a comprehensive database. When you link an OpenSubtitles entry to a specific video file, future users watching the same file automatically get perfectly synchronized subtitles.

The addon intelligently matches subtitles using:
- **Video Hash Matching** - Precise synchronization with your specific video files
- **Community Contributions** - Benefit from subtitles uploaded and linked by other users
- **OpenSubtitles Integration** - Manual selection and linking of any available subtitles
- **Viewing History Tracking** - Your recent activity appears on the homepage for easy management
- **Quality Voting** - Community-driven rating system for subtitle quality
